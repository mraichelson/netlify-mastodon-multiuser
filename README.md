# Netlify Mastodon Multiuser

Oh, hi!

This repo has an example of a [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) serverless function that allows you to proxy multiple [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) aliases using your own domain.

It's based pretty much in it's entirety on [this article by Phil Hawksworth](https://www.hawksworx.com/blog/alias-your-mastodon-username-to-your-domain-with-one-netlify-config-setting/).
